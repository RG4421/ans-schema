# Problem

Currently, audio objects are not in the Content API.  We are now at a point where we would like to add audio objects into the Content API and are honing the audio object to include all of the necessary elements into the json.  Thus, I propose that embed_html, series, and audio_type be added to the json.


# Proposal

Add embed_html, series, and audio_type to audio object.


## Embed_html

HTML for the embedded audio player

## Series

Unique ID for podcast parent objects.  A series is a collection of related podcasts.

## Audio_type

An enumeration of types of audio which will include a "podcast" as one of the types


# Example

```
[
  {
    "type": "audio",
    "_id": "71d86294-f554-11e6-9fb1-2d8f3fc9c0ed",
    "version": "0.8.0",
    "series": "f9753732-624b-4e23-8e35-79e7cbdb1210",
    "audio_type": "podcast"
    .
    .
    .
    "embed_html": "<div class="poda-player-container" data-org= "washpost-sandbox" data-slug="test-episode-0402--2"><script defer src="https://d2lhouwh993x2g.cloudfront.net/sandbox/loader.js"></script></div>",
    .
    .
  }
]
```
