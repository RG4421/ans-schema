# Adding embargo to planning trait

# Problem

When a third party and the news organization agreed to hold a story from publishing until a certain time or certain conditions which have met, currently we don't have the ability to implement this kind of publishing restriction (i.e. news embargo). Therefore this proposal is to provide a way for the authoring applications to apply embargoes.

# Proposal

We propose to add a new `embargo` object which contains active and end_time properties to the planning trait.

### embargo in the trait_planning

{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  "id": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/ans-schema/master/src/main/resources/schema/ans/0.8.1/traits/trait_planning.json",
  "title": "Scheduling information",
  "description": "Trait that applies planning information to a document or resource. In the Arc ecosystem, this data is generated by WebSked. Newsroom use only. All these fields should be available and editable in WebSked.",
  "type": "object",
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "properties": {
    ...,
    "embargo": {
      "description": "Embargo configuration to enforce publishing restrictions",
      "type": "object",
      "additionalProperties": false,
      "properties": {
        "active": {
          "type": "boolean",
          "description": "The boolean flag to indicate if the embargo is active or not"
        },
        "end_time": {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "date-time",
          "description": "An optional end time for the embargo to indicate when it should be ended. The end time should be ignored if active flag is false."
        }
      },
      "required": [ "active" ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Sample Embargo
**Case 1: active embargo without the end time**
```
{
  "type": "story",
  "version": "0.8.1",
  "planning": {
    "embargo": {
      "active": true
    }
  }
}
```
In this case, we should not allow publishing or schedule publishing for the story.

**Case 2: active embargo with the end time in the future**
```
{
  "type": "story",
  "version": "0.8.1",
  "planning": {
    "embargo": {
      "active": true,
      "end_time": "2018-12-31T05:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```
Assuming today is 12/11/2018, in this case, we should not allow publishing now but allow schedule publishing after `2018-12-31T05:00:00Z` for the story.

**Case 3: active embargo with the end time in the past**
```
{
  "type": "story",
  "version": "0.8.1",
  "planning": {
    "embargo": {
      "active": true,
      "end_time": "2018-11-30T05:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```
Assuming today is 12/11/2018, in this case, we should allow publishing and schedule publishing for the story.

**Case 4: inactive embargo with the end time**
```
{
  "type": "story",
  "version": "0.8.1",
  "planning": {
    "embargo": {
      "active": false,
      "end_time": "2020-11-30T05:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```
In this case, the embargo is not active, so we should allow publishing and schedule publishing for the story.

# Concerns

No

# Implementation

Cheng-Hsin Weng from Ellipsis team will implement this and add it to the schema if this proposal is accepted.
